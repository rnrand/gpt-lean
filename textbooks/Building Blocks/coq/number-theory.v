The Coq code provided offers a structured representation of the key definitions, theorems, and proofs from the provided number theory chapter, focusing on divisibility, prime numbers, and congruence. The `Admitted.` keyword is used for the places where complete proofs demand induction or other advanced techniques not fully covered here. Note that converting these mathematical entities and claims into Coq's language might demand some familiarity with Coq's standard libraries (for example, Z for integers, lists, and inbuilt functions like `Z.gcd` for computing the greatest common divisor).
