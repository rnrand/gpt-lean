   Chapter 2
   Logic
   This chapter covers propositional logic and predicate logic at a basic level.
   Some deeper issues will be covered later.
*)

(* 
   2.1 A bit about style
   Writing mathematics requires two things. You need to get the logical ï¬‚ow of
   ideas correct. And you also need to express yourself in standard style, in a
   way that is easy for humans (not computers) to read. Mathematical style is
   best taught by example and is similar to what happens in English classes.
   Mathematical writing uses a combination of equations and also parts that
   look superficially like English. Mathematical English is almost like normal
   English, but differs in some crucial ways.

(* 
   2.2 Propositions
   A proposition is a statement which is true or false (but never both!).
*)

Definition proposition := bool.

(* Examples of propositions *)
Definition urbana_in_illinois : proposition := true.
Definition two_leq_fifteen : proposition := true.

(* 
   2.3 Complex propositions
   Statements can be joined together to make more complex statements. 
*)

Definition and (p q : proposition) : proposition :=
  match p, q with
  | true, true => true
  | _, _ => false
  end.

Definition or (p q : proposition) : proposition :=
  match p, q with
  | false, false => false
  | _, _ => true
  end.

Definition not (p : proposition) : proposition :=
  match p with
  | true => false
  | false => true
  end.

(* Example of complex proposition *)
Definition example_complex_proposition (p q : proposition) : proposition :=
  and p q.

(* 
   2.4 Implication 
*)
Definition implies (p q : proposition) : proposition :=
  or (not p) q.

(* 
   2.5 Converse, contrapositive, biconditional
*)
Definition converse (p q : proposition) : proposition :=
  implies q p.

Definition contrapositive (p q : proposition) : proposition :=
  implies (not q) (not p).

Definition biconditional (p q : proposition) : proposition :=
  and (implies p q) (implies q p).

(* 
   2.6 Complex statements
   Very complex statements can be made using combinations of connectives.
*)
Definition complex_statement_example (p q r s : proposition) : proposition :=
  implies (or p (not q)) (and (not r) (not s)).

(* 
   2.7 Logical Equivalence
   Two propositions p and q are logically equivalent if they are true for
   exactly the same input values. 
*)
Definition logically_equivalent (p q : proposition) : proposition :=
  and (implies p q) (implies q p).

(* De Morgan's Laws *)
Theorem de_morgan_law1 : forall p q : proposition, not (and p q) = or (not p) (not q).
Proof.
  intros p q.
  case p, q; reflexivity.
Qed.

Theorem de_morgan_law2 : forall p q : proposition, not (or p q) = and (not p) (not q).
Proof.
  intros p q.
  case p, q; reflexivity.
Qed.

(* 
   2.10 Predicates and Variables
*)

(* A predicate is a function from a domain to propositions. *)
Definition predicate (X : Type) := X -> proposition.

(* Examples of predicates *)
Definition isEven (n : nat) : proposition :=
  Nat.even n.

Definition isOdd (n : nat) : proposition :=
  not (isEven n).

(* 
   2.12 Notation for Quantifiers
*)

(* Universal quantifier *)
Definition forall_nat (P : nat -> proposition) : proposition :=
  (* Simulating the universal quantifier for demonstration purposes *)
  P 0. (* Placeholder *)

(* Existential quantifier simulated for demonstration purposes *)
Definition exists_nat (P : nat -> proposition) : proposition :=
  (* This is just for demonstration and does not truly capture existential quantification *)
  P 1. (* Placeholder *)

(* Examples *)
Definition forall_example : proposition := forall_nat (fun n => true).
Definition exists_example : proposition := exists_nat (fun n => true).

  This Coq file includes descriptions and basic implementations or placeholders
  for concepts in propositional and predicate logic. It simplifies certain aspects
  for illustration and provides foundational logic constructs as Coq definitions
  and functions.
