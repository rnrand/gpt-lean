   Chapter 6: Relations

   Mathematical relations are an extremely general framework for specifying
   relationships between pairs of objects. This chapter surveys the types of
   relations that can be constructed on a single set A and the properties used
   to characterize different types of relations.

(* 
   6.1 Relations

   A relation R on a set A is a subset of A x A, i.e. R is a set of ordered pairs
   of elements from A. For simplicity, we will assume that the base set A is
   always non-empty. If R contains the pair (x, y), we say that x is related to
   y, or xRy in shorthand. We'll write x~Ry to mean that x is not related to y.
*)

Context {A : Type}.

Definition relation := A -> A -> Prop.

(* 
   For example, suppose we let A be the set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.
   We can define a relation W on A by xWy if and only if x <= y <= x + 2. 
*)

Variable W : relation.

(* Example of relation W definition for natural numbers, with a slightly different set. *)
(* Hypothesis W_example : forall x y : nat, W x y <-> x <= y /\ y <= x + 2. *) (* 

(* Relations can also be defined on infinite sets or multi-dimensional objects. *)

(* 
   6.2 Properties of relations: reflexive

   The formal definition states that if R is a relation on a set A then
   - R is reflexive if xRx for all x ∈ A.
   - R is irreflexive if x~Rx for all x ∈ A.
*)

Definition reflexive (R : relation) := forall x, R x x.

Definition irreflexive (R : relation) := forall x, ~ R x x.

(* 
   6.3 Symmetric and antisymmetric

   The formal definitions of symmetric and antisymmetric relations.
*)

Definition symmetric (R : relation) := forall x y, R x y -> R y x.

Definition antisymmetric (R : relation) :=
  forall x y, R x y -> R y x -> x = y.

(* 
   6.4 Transitive

   The formal definition of transitivity.
*)

Definition transitive (R : relation) :=
  forall x y z, R x y -> R y z -> R x z.

(* 
   6.5 Types of relations
   
   - A partial order is a relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.
   - A linear order (also called a total order) is a partial order R in which
     every pair of elements are comparable.
   - A strict partial order is a relation that is irreflexive, antisymmetric,
     and transitive.
   - An equivalence relation is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
*)

Definition partial_order (R : relation) :=
  reflexive R /\ antisymmetric R /\ transitive R.

Definition linear_order (R : relation) :=
  partial_order R /\ forall x y, R x y \/ R y x.

Definition strict_partial_order (R : relation) :=
  irreflexive R /\ antisymmetric R /\ transitive R.

Definition equivalence_relation (R : relation) :=
  reflexive R /\ symmetric R /\ transitive R.

End Relations.

(*
This Coq representation covered the main conceptual parts of the chapter, including the definitions and properties of relations, as well as the introduction to different types of relations such as partial orders and equivalence relations. Remember that specific examples, such as relations W, S, and T provided in the text, would need actual implementations if used in concrete circumstances, and the hypotheses assumed (like `W_example`) serve as illustrative placeholders. *)
