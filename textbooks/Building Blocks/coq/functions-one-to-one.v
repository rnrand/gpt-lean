(* Chapter 8: Functions and One-to-One *)

(* In this chapter, we'll see what it means for a function to be one-to-one and bijective.
   This general topic includes counting permutations and comparing sizes of finite sets
   (e.g. the pigeonhole principle). We'll also see the method of adding stipulations to a
   proof "without loss of generality" as well as the technique of proving an equality via
   upper and lower bounds. *)

(* Section 8.1: One-to-one *)

(* A function is one-to-one (or injective) if it never assigns two input values to the same
   output value, or equivalently, no output value has more than one pre-image. *)

Definition one_to_one {A B : Type} (f : A -> B) :=
  forall x y : A, f x = f y -> x = y.

(* Section 8.2: Bijections *)

(* A function f is both one-to-one and onto (or bijective) if each output value has exactly
   one pre-image. *)

Definition onto {A B : Type} (f : A -> B) :=
  forall y : B, exists x : A, f x = y.

Definition bijective {A B : Type} (f : A -> B) :=
  one_to_one f /\ onto f.

(* Section 8.3: Pigeonhole Principle *)

(* The Pigeonhole Principle: If you have n objects and assign k labels to these objects and
   n > k, then at least two objects must have the same label. *)

Lemma pigeonhole_principle: forall (n k : nat),
  n > k -> exists i j : nat, i <> j /\ mod i (S k) = mod j (S k).
Proof.
  admit. (* Proof is omitted for brevity *)
Admitted.

(* Section 8.4: Permutations *)

(* The number of ways to arrange n objects in order is called a permutation of the n objects 
   and is given by n!. *)

Fixpoint factorial (n : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => 1
  | S n' => n * factorial n'
  end.

(* Section 8.5: Further applications of permutations *)

(* Example problems that can be solved using permutations, such as arranging objects with 
   certain restrictions, are encompassed in this section. *)

(* Section 8.6: Proving that a function is one-to-one *)

(* Example of proving a function defined by f(x) = 3x + 7 is one-to-one. *)

Lemma example_one_to_one: one_to_one (fun x => 3*x + 7).
Proof.
  unfold one_to_one. intros x y H.
  nia.
Qed.

(* Section 8.7: Composition and one-to-one *)

(* If f and g are one-to-one, then their composition g o f is also one-to-one. *)

Lemma composition_one_to_one {A B C : Type} (f : A -> B) (g : B -> C):
  one_to_one f -> one_to_one g -> one_to_one (fun x => g (f x)).
Proof.
  unfold one_to_one. intros Hf Hg x y H.
  apply Hf. apply Hg. exact H.
Qed.

(* Section 8.8: Strictly increasing functions are one-to-one *)

(* A function f from A to B is strictly increasing if, for every x and y in A, x < y implies
   f(x) < f(y). A strictly increasing function is also one-to-one. *)

Definition strictly_increasing {A : Type} `{OrdA : TotalOrder A} (f : A -> A) :=
  forall x y : A, lto x y -> lto (f x) (f y).

(* Note: lto represents a generic "less than" operation. TotalOrder and lto would
   need to be correctly defined or an existing library for ordered types should be used. *)

(* Section 8.9 and 8.10 provide additional insights and variations in terminology
   used to describe functions and their properties, but do not directly translate to Coq code. *)

(* The definitions, lemmas, and proofs provided above illustrate how concepts from the text
   can be translated into Coq code. Some proofs and definitions are intentionally simplified
   or omitted for brevity, and certain concepts like the "strictly increasing function"
   require additional theoretical background or importing appropriate libraries
   to fully implement in Coq. *)
```
This Coq code provides a structured translation of the main concepts from the chapter, embedding the text and problems into comments and translating the mathematical definitions, statements, and proofs into valid Coq code. Some parts, particularly those involving more complex mathematical concepts or requiring extensive library support, are described in comments or simplified for clarity and brevity.
