    <h2>Modular arithmetic</h2>
    <p>Now, we'll define a system of arithmetic on integers based around remainders. Many times, we want to do a certain style of "clock arithmetic", where 1:00 is equivalent to 13:00 (which in turn is equal to 25:00, if you've been up too late working on problem sets). Modular arithmetic formalizes these notions. One of the things we'll see is that in certain cases, working in these structures gives us a notion of "division" that is well-defined. The system of modular arithmetic was first developed by Gauss.

    <p><strong>Definition 8.1.</strong> Let $m$ be a positive integer. For integers $a$ and $b$, we say that $a$ is <strong>congruent</strong> to $b$ <strong>modulo</strong> $m$, written $a = b \pmod m$ or $a \equiv_m b$, if $m \mid (a-b)$. 
		
	<p>We need to be careful to distinguish the notion of equivalence $a \pmod m$ versus the function $a \mathop{\mathbf{mod}} m$. However, there is a tight connection between the two:

    <p><strong>Theorem 8.2.</strong> $a \equiv_m b$ if and only if $a \mathop{\mathbf{mod}} m = b \mathop{\mathbf{mod}} m$.

    <p><em>Proof.</em> 
    <ol>
    <li>Using the Division theorem, let $a = q_1m + r_1$ and $b = q_2m + r_2$.
    <li>Hence $a - b = (q_1 - q_2)m + (r_1 - r_2)$.
    <li>If $m \mid (a-b)$ then given that $m$ divides $(q_1 - q_2)m$, we can derive that $m$ must also divide $r_1 - r_2$. 
	<li>Since $-m \lt r_1 - r_2 \lt m$, we have $r_1 - r_2 = 0$, therefore $r_1 = r_2$.
    <li>In the other direction, if $r_1 = r_2$ then $a - b = (q_1 - q_2)m$. So $m \mid (a-b)$.
    </ol>
    $$\tag*{$\Box$}$$


    <p>We want to show that $\equiv_m$ is actually an equivalence relation. Recall that an equivalence relation must be <em>reflexive</em>, <em>symmetric</em>, and <em>transitive</em>.

    <p><strong>Theorem 8.3.</strong> For $m \gt 0$, $\equiv_m$ is an equivalence relation.

    <p><em>Proof.</em> 
    <ol>
    <li>To see that $\equiv_m$ is reflexive, observe that $m \mid (a-a)$ for all integers $a$. 
    <li>To see that $\equiv_m$ is symmetric, if $a \equiv_m b$, then $m \mid (a - b)$. This means there is an integer $n$ such that $a - b = mn$. Then we get $b - a = m\cdot (-n)$ and we have $m \mid (b-a)$.
    <li>To see that $\equiv_m$ is transitive, consider integers $a,b,c$ such that $a \equiv_m b$ and $b \equiv_m c$. We have $m \mid (a-b)$ and $m \mid (b-c)$, which gives us $m \mid (a-b) + (b-c)$ and therefore, $m \mid (a-c)$ and $a \equiv_m c$.
    </ol>
    $$\tag*{$\Box$}$$
	
	<p>Alternatively, we could have simply appealed to Theorem 8.2 (which uses $\leftrightarrow$, another equivalence relation) and then used the fact that $=$ is an equivalence relation!

		<h3>Equivalence Classes and the Integers Modulo $m$</h3>

		<p>Using the notion of an equivalence relation, we can divide $\mathbb Z$
		into sets that contain equivalent members. For instance, if we choose $m =
		2$, then all even numbers $e$ are equivalent to each other ($e \equiv_m 0$)
		and all odd numbers $o$ are equivalent to each other ($o \equiv_m 1$).
		These sets are called <em>equivalence classes</em>.

		<p>We're going to formalize what it means to "work modulo $m$" for some
		positive integer $m$. Intuitively, we want a rigorous way of modeling
		situations where we only care about numbers modulo another number. For
		example, if we're using time, we might care about questions like: If it is
		10 o'clock now, what time will it be in 5 hours?

		<p>Our plan is define <em>equivalence classes</em> of integers, and then
		do the arithmetic with them directly. This is pretty abstract, but also
		arguably beautiful. This technique also generalizes vastly, which you'll
		see if you opt to study more math, in particular abstract algebra.

		<p><strong>Definition 8.4.</strong> For all $m \gt 0$ and $a \in \mathbb
		Z$, we define the <strong>equivalence class of $a$ modulo $m$</strong> to
		be the set $$[a]_m = \{b \in \mathbb Z \mid b \equiv_m a\}.$$

		<p>Typically, we refer to equivalence classes by the "obvious" name, which
		is the member of the class that is between 0 and $m-1$. This is called the
		<em>canonical representative</em> of the class. Of course, we should keep
		in mind that $[0] = [m] = [2m] = [-m]$ and such. But in addition to this,
		sometimes the $[]_m$ gets dropped for convenience's sake and we have to
		determine from context whether "2" means $2 \in \mathbb Z$ or $[2]_m$.
		Usually, this becomes clear with the usage of $\pmod m$ and we will try to
		make that explicit, but outside of this course, that's not always
		guaranteed.

		<p><strong>Definition 8.6.</strong>  Let $m$ be a positive integers.  The
		<strong>integers modulo $m$</strong> is the set $$\mathbb{Z}_m = \{ [a]_m \
		\mid\ a\in\mathbb{Z}\}.$$

		<p>Note that $\mathbb{Z}_m$ is a set of sets of integers. That is,
		$\mathbb{Z}_m \subseteq P(\mathbb{Z})$.
		
    <p>Our plan is to define a type of "addition" and "multiplication"
		that operate on the equivalence classes in $\mathbb{Z}_m$. Regular
		addition and multiplication won't do: Those operate on integers, not
		sets. To set this up, we'll use the following theorem.

    <p><strong>Theorem 8.5.</strong> Let $m$ be a positive integer. For
		all $a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2\in\mathbb{Z}$, if $[a_1]_m = [a_2]_m$ and
		$[b_1]_m = [b_2]_m$, then
		$$
		[a_1+b_1]_m = [a_2 + b_2]_m
		$$
		and
		$$
		[a_1b_1]_m = [a_2b_2]_m.
		$$
    

		<p>Before the proof, here is an example showing why this is useful.
		Let $m=5,a_1=66, b_1=104$, and suppose we want $[a_1+b_1]_5$ and
		$[a_1b_1]_5$. We can multiply these out directly, getting $[170]_5$ and
		$[6864]_5$ respectively. Another way is to pick $a_2=1$ and $b_2=4$, which
		satisfy $[a_1]_5 = [a_2]_5$ and $[b_1]_5 = [b_2]_5$. Then
		$$
		[66+104]_5 = [1 + 4]_5 = [5]_5 = [0]_5
		$$
		and
		$$
		[66\cdot 104]_5 = [1 \cdot 4]_5 = [4]_5. 
		$$

		<p>The point is that we avoid working with the larger numbers $66$ and
		$104$, and immediately "mod them down" to $1$ and $4$, simplifying the
		computation. Working by hand, this is a nice trick, but it is very
		important for computers doing modular arithmetic with large integers, since
		it allows them to control how large the numbers get by "modding down".
		

		<p><em>Proof.</em>  Let $m$ be a positive integer, and assume
		$a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2$ satisfy the condition in the theorem. Since
		$[a_1]_m=[a_2]_m$, we have $a_1 \equiv_m a_2$, i.e. $m|(a_1-a_2)$.
		Similarly, $m|(b_1-b_2)$. Thus $m$ divides the sum of these numbers, i.e.
		$m|((a_1-a_2)+(b_1-b_2))$. But $(a_1-a_2)+(b_1-b_2)=(a_1+b_1)-(a_2+b_2)$,
		so we actually know that $m|((a_1+b_1)-(a_2+b_2))$, i.e.  $(a_1+b_1)
		\equiv_m (a_2+b_2)$. By the definition of equivalence classes, this shows
		$[a_1+b_1]_m = [a_2 + b_2]_m$.
		

		<p>For the claim about multiplication, it suffices to show that $a_1b_1
		\equiv_m a_2b_2$, i.e. $m|(a_1 b_1 - a_2 b_2)$.  Since $m \mid (a_1 - a_2)$
		and $m \mid (b_1 - b_2)$ there exist integers $k$ and $\ell$ such that $km
		= a_1 - a_2$ and $\ell m = b_1 - b_2$. Then, 
    \begin{align*}
    a_1 b_1 - a_2 b_2 &= (a_2 + km) (b_2 + \ell m) - a_2 b_2 \\
    &= a_2 b_2 + a_2 \ell m + b_2 k m + k \ell m^2 - a_2 b_2 \\
    &= m(a_2 \ell + b_2 k + k \ell m)
    \end{align*}
		and therefore, $m \mid (a_1 b_1 - a_2 b_2)$ and $a_1 b_1 \equiv_m a_2 b_2$.
		(Above, the first equality simply used that $a_1=a_2+km$ and $b_1=b_2+\ell
		m$, a somewhat tricky step to find!)
    $$\tag*{$\Box$}$$

		<p>We can use this to define addition and multiplication of equivalence
		classes, as promised. Let $C_1,C_2\in \mathbb{Z}_m$. We define an
		operation $+_m$ by
		$$
		C_1 +_m C_2 = C_3,
		$$
		where $C_3 \in \mathbb{Z}_m$ is the equivalence class defined by first
		choosing <em>any</em> $a \in C_1$, <em>any</em> $b\in C_2$, and
		defining $C_3 = [a+b]_m$. Beautifully, the previous theorem
		says that no matter how we pick $a$ and $b$, we'll get the same $C_3$!
		Thus we can express the definition of $+_m$ as
		$$
		[a]_m +_m [b]_m = [a+b]_m,
		$$
		and <em>this is a rigorous definition</em>.

		<p>We can repeat all of this with multiplication; We get an operation
		$\cdot_m$ defined as
		$$
		[a]_m \cdot_m [b]_m = [ab]_m,
		$$
		with the same promises as above.

    <p>Now, we can define our structure.
    
    <p><strong>Definition 8.6.</strong> Let $\mathbb Z_m = \{[0]_m, [1]_m, \dots, [m-1]_m\}$. The <strong>integers mod $m$</strong> is the set $\mathbb Z_m$, together with the binary operations $+$ and $\cdot$. The integers mod $m$ are denoted by $\mathbb Z/\equiv_m$ or simply as $\mathbb Z_m$.

    <p>Up to now, we have been working implicitly in the structure $\mathbb Z$, the integers. As I've briefly alluded to before, we're not only talking about the domain $\mathbb Z$ but also how we interpret operations like $+$ and $\cdot$. The integers mod $m$, $\mathbb Z_m$, is another structure, whose basic elements are the equivalence classes with respect to $\equiv_m$.

    <p>These kinds of structures&mdash;a set together with binary operations $+$ and $\cdot$ and identities for both operations&mdash; are called <em>rings</em>. 

    <p>The notation $\mathbb Z/\equiv_m$ gives us a hint at what's happening. We took $\mathbb Z$ and partitioned it into equivalence classes by the relation $\equiv_m$. This idea of taking an algebraic structure and constructing another structure based on an equivalence relation is something that comes up a lot in algebra and is called a <em>quotient</em> structure, where quotient in the algebraic context just means equivalence class.
