    <p><strong>Lemma 7.0.</strong> Let $n$ and $d \gt 0$ be arbitrary integers. For any integers $q$ and $r$ such that $n = d \cdot q + r$ and $0 \leq r \lt d$, $q$ and $r$ are unique.

    <p>Suppose that there exist integers $q_1, r_1, q_2, r_2$ such that $n = d \cdot q_1 + r_1$ and $n = d \cdot q_2 + r_2$ with $0 \leq r_1, r_2 \lt d$. Consider the following system of equations
    \begin{align*}
    n &= q_1 \cdot d + r_1 \\
    n &= q_2 \cdot d + r_2.
    \end{align*}
    Subtracting gives us $0 = (q_1 - q_2) \cdot d + (r_1 - r_2)$. Rearranging this equation gives us $(q_2 - q_1) \cdot d = r_1 - r_2$. Since $(q_2 - q_1)$ is an integer, we have $d \mid (r_1 - r_2)$ by definition of divisibility. Since $-d \lt r_1 - r_2 \lt d$, we have $r_1 - r_2 = 0$ and therefore $r_1 = r_2$. Then from above, this gives us $(q_2 - q_1) \cdot d = 0$. Since $d \gt 0$, we have $q_2 - q_1 = 0$ and therefore $q_1 = q_2$. Thus, we have shown that $q$ and $r$ are unique.
    $$\tag*{$\Box$}$$

    <p><strong>Definition 7.1.</strong> Let $n$ and $d \gt 0$ be integers. We define the functions $n \mathop{\mathbf{div}} d = q$ and $n \mathop{\mathbf{mod}} d = r$, where $q$ and $r$ are as defined by the Division Theorem.

    <p>These functions are defined as in the Rosen textbook and are standard definitions. We can think of $\mathbf{div}$ as the integer division operation in many programming languages that just returns the quotient and $\mathbf{mod}$ is the modulus operator. However, if we recall the painstaking work to define functions as a special kind of relation, these aren't really functions because they're undefined for $d = 0$. Unfortunately, this is the way it is.
 
    <p><strong>Definition 7.2.</strong> The set of divisors of $n$ is defined by $\operatorname{Div}(n) = \{a : a \mid n\}$.

    <p>This is a nice definition because it is obvious what the common divisors of $m$ and $n$ are supposed to be: the intersection of $\operatorname{Div}(m)$ and $\operatorname{Div}(n)$.

    <p><strong>Definition 7.3.</strong> If $m$ and $n$ are integers with $m \neq 0$ or $n \neq 0$, then the <strong>greatest common divisor</strong> of $m$ and $n$, denoted $\gcd(m,n)$, is the largest element of $\operatorname{Div}(m) \cap \operatorname{Div}(n)$.
    </blockquote>

    <p>From the way we've defined this, it's not entirely obvious that the gcd should exist. Without loss of generality, let $m \neq 0$. Then $\operatorname{Div}(m)$ has a largest element $m$ and a smallest element $-m$. This means that $\operatorname{Div}(m)$ is finite and that $\operatorname{Div}(m) \cap \operatorname{Div}(n)$ is also finite. Since 1 is a divisor for every integer, we know that $1 \in \operatorname{Div}(m) \cap \operatorname{Div}(n)$, which means that $\operatorname{Div}(m) \cap \operatorname{Div}(n)$ is non-empty. Since it's not empty, $\operatorname{Div}(m) \cap \operatorname{Div}(n)$ must contain a largest element, which is the gcd.

	<h3>Bézout's Identity</h3>

    <p>From the Division Theorem, we get the following result about the gcd by Étienne Bézout in the mid-1700s. 

    <p><strong>Theorem 7.4 (Bézout's Identity).</strong> For all integers $a$ and $b$ where $a$ or $b$ is nonzero, there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $\gcd(a,b) = a \cdot x + b \cdot y$.

	<p><em>Proof.</em> Consider the set $S = \{ax + by \mid x,y \in \mathbb Z\}$. Note that it contains strictly positive (greater than zero) numbers, for instance $a^2+b^2$. Let $c = as + bt$ be the smallest strictly positive member of $S$.
		
	<p>We first have to show that $c$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$. Let's show $c \mid a$ first. Applying the Division Theorem, we have some $q$ and $0 \le r \lt c$ such that
	\begin{align*}
	a &= qc + r  \Rightarrow  \\
	r &= a - qc \\
	&= a - q(as + bt) \\
	&= a(1-qs) - bqt
	\end{align*}
	<p>Therefore $r \in S$. Since $0 \le r \lt c$ and $c$ is the smallest strictly positive member of $S$, $r$ must be $0$.
		
		We've shown that $c \mid a$. The proof that $c \mid b$ follows similarly.
		
	<p>Now we need to show that $c$ is the <em>greatest</em> common divisor. Assume $d \mid a$ and $d \mid b$. Then $d \mid (as + bt)$ by Theorem 6.5 from last class. Since $d \mid c$ and $c$ is strictly positive, $d$ must be less than or equal to $c$. This completes the proof.
$$\tag*{$\Box$}$$		 

	<h3>Euclid's Algorithm</h3>

    <p>Bézout's identity is interesting in that it provides a characterization for the gcd of $m$ and $n$. Suppose we have $m$, $n$, and what we think is $\gcd(m,n)$. Is there a way to check that the gcd is really correct without computing it? If we had the coefficients of Bézout's identity for $m$ and $n$, then we could check very easily. Of course, we're getting a bit ahead of ourselves, but keep this idea in mind while we tackle a more immediate question: how does one compute the gcd? 

    <p>The obvious way to do this is to compute the set of divisors for $m$ and $n$, compute their intersection, and take the largest element in the intersection. The big problem with this approach is that factoring integers is a notoriously hard problem to solve efficiently. There are some heuristics that we can apply and some tricks that we can pull, but in general we do not have a fast algorithm for factoring numbers. This fact happens to be the backbone of many public-key cryptographic systems we use today.

    <p>However, if all we care about is the <em>greatest</em> common divisor and not any of the other divisors, then the following theorem will get us there efficiently.

    <p><strong>Theorem 7.5.</strong> If $c = \gcd(a,b)$ and $b \neq 0$ then $c = \gcd(b, a \mathop{\mathbf{mod}} b)$.

	<p><em>Proof.</em> Let $q = a \mathop{\mathbf{div}} b$ and $r = a \mathop{\mathbf{mod}} b$. It's easiest to just show that $\text{Div}(a) \cap \text{Div}(b) = \text{Div(a)} \cap \text{Div}(r)$. Our trusty Theorem 6.5 will be helpful again. Suppose that $x \mid a$ and $x \mid b$. Then $x \mid (a - qb) = r$. Conversely, if $y \mid b$ and $y \mid r$ then $y \mid (qb+r) = a$. Since the sets are the same, they share a greatest element. 
    $$\tag*{$\Box$}$$

    <p>This result gives us a way to compute the gcd:
    $$\gcd(a,b) = \begin{cases} a & \text{if $b = 0$,} \\ \gcd(b, a \mathop{\mathbf{mod}} b) & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases}$$

    <p>This algorithm is called Euclid's algorithm, named after Euclid who describes it in the Elements. Euclid is the Greek mathematician from around 300 BC who, in the Elements, describes a lot of the elementary geometry, algebra, and number theory that we learn in school.

    <p><strong>Example 7.6.</strong> Suppose we want to compute the gcd of 232 and 72. We apply Euclid's algorithm as follows:
    \begin{align*}
    \gcd(232,72) &= \gcd(72,16) \\
    &= \gcd(16,8) \\
    &= \gcd(8,0) \\
    &= 8
    \end{align*}

    <p><strong>Example 7.7.</strong> Suppose we randomly pick the (rather too large) numbers 924 and 126 and want to compute their greatest common divisor. We apply Euclid's algorithm again:
    \begin{align*}
    \gcd(924, 126) &= \gcd(126,42) \\
    &= \gcd(42,0) \\
	&= 42
    \end{align*}
	Which famously is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything_(42)">The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything</a>. It was also, until recently, the only diophantine equation of the form $x = a^3 + b^3 + c^3$ for $x \lt 100$ yet to be <a href="https://blogs.tip.duke.edu/insights/mathematicians-spent-65-years-to-solve-for-the-number-42-but-why/">solved</a>. 

    <!-- <p>This leads us to the notion of the existence of an <em>Extended</em> Euclidean algorithm. The EEA is an algorithm that computes the gcd of $a$ and $b$ <em>and</em> the coefficients $x$ and $y$ from Bézout's lemma. We can treat these coefficients as a certificate or sanity test that the gcd we computed was really correct without having recompute the entire thing later on. The EEA gives us a way to compute the gcd so that without doing a lot of extra work, $a$ and $b$ fall out almost for free. -->

    <!--
    <p>How does it work? For two integers $x$ and $y$, we iteratively compute the following values:
    <ul>
        <li>$a_i = a_{x,i} \cdot x + a_{y,i} \cdot y$,
        <li>$b_i = b_{x,i} \cdot x + b_{y,i} \cdot y$,
        <li>$\gcd(a_i,b_i) = \gcd(x,y)$.
    </ul>
    <p>using initial values
    <ul>
        <li>$a_0 = x, a_{x,0} = 1, a_{y,0} = 0$, and
        <li>$b_0 = y, b_{x,0} = 0, b_{y,0} = 1$.
    </ul>

    <p>We then compute $q$ and $r$ by computing the following:
    \begin{align*}
    r &= a_i - q \cdot b_i \\
    &= (a_{x,i} \cdot x + a_{y,i} \cdot y) - q \cdot (b_{x,i} \cdot x + b_{y,i} \cdot y) \\
    &= (a_{x,i} - q \cdot b_{x,i}) + (a_{y,i} - q \cdot b_{y,i}) \cdot y.
    \end{align*}
    <p>Once we have these values, we can set the next iteration by
    <ul>
        <li>$a_{i+1} = b_i, a_{x,i+1} = b_{x,i}, a_{y,i+1} = b_{y,i}$,
        <li>$b_{i+1} = r, b_{x,i+1} = a_{x,i} - q \cdot b_{x,i}, b_{y,i+1} = a_{y,i} - q \cdot b_{y,i}$.
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example 4.15.</strong> Repeating our computation from above, we set $x = 232$ and $y = 72$. The EEA gives us the following.

    <table>
    <tr><th>$i$ <th>$a$ <th>$a_x$ <th>$a_y$ <th>$b$ <th>$b_x$ <th>$b_y$
    <tr><td>1 <td>232 <td>1 <td>0 <td>72 <td>0 <td>1
    <tr><td>2 <td>72 <td>0 <td>1 <td>16 <td>1 <td>-3
    <tr><td>3 <td>16 <td>1 <td>-3 <td>8 <td>-4 <td>13
    <tr><td>4 <td>8 <td>-4 <td>13 <td>0 <td>9 <td>-29
    </table>
    <p>From the final row of the table, we get $\gcd(232,72) = 8, a = -4, b = 13$. Put together, we check $8 = 232 \cdot (-4) + 72 \cdot 13$.
