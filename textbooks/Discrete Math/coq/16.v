(* Definition 15.1: r-permutation is a permutation of r elements taken from a set of n elements. *)
(* This definition is implicitly understood in Coq and related to the factorial function and notion of permutations *)

(* Theorem 15.2: Number of r-permutations of an n-element set P(n,r) = n * (n-1) * ... * (n-r+1). *)
Fixpoint P (n r : nat) : nat :=
  match r with
  | 0 => 1
  | S r' => if n <? r then 0 else n * P (n - 1) r'
  end.

(* Corollary 15.3: P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)! when 0 <= r <= n and n > 0 *)
Lemma factorial_minus : forall n r, r <= n -> (factorial n) / (factorial (n - r)) = P n r.
Proof.
  induction n as [|n IH]; intros r H.
  - simpl. now rewrite <- beq_nat_refl.
  - destruct r.
    + simpl. now rewrite Nat.sub_0_r.
    + simpl. rewrite <- IH by lia.
      remember (n - r) as m. clear Heqm.
      rewrite <- Nat.mul_assoc. f_equal.
      assert (Hmn: m = n - r) by lia. rewrite Hmn.
      reflexivity.
Qed.

(* Example 15.4 skipped due to it being primarily narrative without direct Coq relevance *)

(* Example 15.5: Counting single-occurrence words of length 6 containing the substring 315 from a 9-symbol alphabet *)
Definition P_example_15_5 : nat := 4 * P 6 3.

(* Combinations *)
(* Definition 15.6: An r-combination of a set A with n elements is a subset of r elements from A *)
Definition C (n r : nat) : nat := factorial n / (factorial r * factorial (n - r)).

(* Example 15.7: For a set A with 3 elements, the number of 2-combinations is 3 *)
Example C_example_15_7 : C 3 2 = 3.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(* Theorem 15.8: The number of r-combinations from an n-element set C(n,r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!) *)
Lemma C_def: forall n r, C n r = n! / (r! * (n - r)!).
Proof.
  intros. unfold C. reflexivity.
Qed.

(* Example 15.9: Considering only the selection of the top 5 presidents from a group of 45, we use combinations *)
Definition C_example_15_9 : nat := C 45 5.

(* Theorem 15.10: C(n,r) = C(n,n-r) *)
Theorem C_symmetry : forall n r, r <= n -> C n r = C n (n-r).
Proof.
  intros n r H. unfold C. rewrite (Nat.mul_comm (factorial r) _). rewrite (Nat.mul_comm (factorial (n - r)) _).
  f_equal. f_equal. lia.
Qed.

(* Example 15.11: Counting balanced binary words of length n *)
Definition balanced_words n : nat := if even n then C n (n / 2) else 0.

(* Example 15.12 illustrates when to use permutations vs combinations but is omitted as a direct Coq translation due to its descriptive nature *)
