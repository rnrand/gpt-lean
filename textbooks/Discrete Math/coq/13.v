(* Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (continued) *)
(* We begin with the statement and proof of Euclid's Lemma. *)

(* Theorem 12.1: Euclid's Lemma *)
Theorem euclid_lemma : forall p a b, prime p -> p | a * b -> p | a \/ p | b.
Proof.
  (* The proof by Euclid uses concepts such as gcd, which replaces Bézout's lemma used in the original proof. *)
  admit.
Qed.
(* Notice that the original proof referenced makes use of Bézout's lemma, a result that came much later than Euclid's time. *)

(* Next, we aim to prove a lemma that helps establish the uniqueness part of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. *)

(* Lemma 12.2 *)
Lemma prime_divides_other_prime: forall p p1 p2 ... pk,
  prime p -> prime p1 -> ... -> prime pk ->
  p | (p1 ... * pk) -> exists i, p = pi.
Proof.
  (* We use induction on k, the number of primes. *)
  admit.
Qed.
(* The inductive proof essentially builds on Euclid's Lemma and progresses by considering cases and utilizing induction. *)

(* Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (Uniqueness). *)
(* Claim: The prime factorizations of any integer are unique, disregarding the order of factors. *)

(* We skip the detailed formalization here but note that it would involve detailed induction on the structure and properties of prime factorizations. *)

(* Euclid's Theorem *)
Theorem infinity_primes : exists inf_list_of_primes, True.
Proof.
  (* Proof by contradiction assuming finitely many primes and constructing a new prime. *)
  admit.
Qed.
(* The proof constructs a number n = p1 ... * pk + 1, leading to a contradiction by showing that n cannot be factored into the assumed finite list of primes. *)

(* Here we begin the discussion on the Frobenius problem *)

(* Theorem 11.7: Representation of natural numbers as a linear combination of 4 and 5 for all n >= 12 *)
Theorem frobenius_4_5 : forall n, n >= 12 -> exists a b, n = 4*a + 5*b.
Proof.
  (* The proof can be approached using regular induction or strong induction. *)
  admit.
Qed.

(* Theorem 11.8: With denominations of 20, 9, and 6, every number n >= 44 can be represented. *)
Theorem frobenius_20_9_6 : forall n, n >= 44 -> exists a b c, n = 20*a + 9*b + 6*c.
Proof.
  (* This theorem is proved using strong induction, highlighting the capability of handling more complex base cases. *)
  admit.
Qed.

(* The detailed proofs explore specific base cases and inductive steps, illustrating the power of mathematical induction in proving statements about natural numbers and their properties.*)

(* Note: Some proof details and certain intermediary lemmas or results are omitted for brevity and clarity. In practice, these would require careful development and formalization in Coq, including the establishment of necessary lemmas and handling of base cases and inductive steps with precision. *)

This Coq script encapsulates the essence of translating the HTML document's mathematical content into formal statements within the Coq proof assistant. It includes placeholders for parts of proofs that would require detailed formalization and a clear understanding of Coq's powerful induction capabilities, arithmetic libraries, and logical foundations. Actual proofs of the theorems, especially those involving induction, would involve constructing the base case and inductive step rigorously, ensuring all necessary lemmas and definitions are in place.
