This Coq script starts with importing necessary libraries and opening the scope for integer operations. It then proceeds by translating each section of the original HTML document into comments or Coq code as appropriate, including lemmas, definitions, and examples. Note that for the definition of division and modulus (`div` and `modulo`), Coq already includes these operations but requires handling zero cases, so custom definitions have been provided to partly mimic the HTML document's narrative.
