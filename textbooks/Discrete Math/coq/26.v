(* We start by defining a bipartite graph. While Coq's standard library does not include a graph theory library, we can represent graphs using adjacency lists or adjacency matrices for the purpose of illustrating Hall's Theorem and Berge's Lemma. However, a complete formalization of these theorems would require significantly more setup, including definitions for matchings, paths, etc., which are not included here. Thus, the following should be seen as indicative sketch rather than fully formal proofs. *)

Section BipartiteGraph.

(* A bipartite graph is represented as two disjoint sets of vertices V1 and V2, and a set of edges E that connect vertices from V1 to V2. *)
Context {V1 V2 E: Type}.
Context {V1_dec: forall x y: V1, {x = y} + {x <> y}}.
Context {V2_dec: forall x y: V2, {x = y} + {x <> y}}.

(* Theorem 25.11 (Hall's Matching Theorem) 
   For simplicity, we model neighbors and subsets abstractly. A complete formalization would involve substantially more foundational work including finite sets and their cardinality, and the definition of neighborhoods. *)
(*
Theorem Halls_Matching_Theorem: forall (G: BipartiteGraph V1 V2 E) (A: Subset V1),
Corresponding Coq formulation requires significant preliminary definitions that are not provided here.
*)

(* Proof: (sketch)
The proof of Hall's theorem requires a significant amount of setup in Coq, including defining what a matching is, proving properties about subsets and cardinalities, and more. The proof structure in informal mathematics translates to constructive proofs in Coq, often requiring induction, which in the case of Hall's theorem might be on the size of a subset of vertices.
*)

(* Berge's Lemma and related definitions would also require significant foundational work in Coq, such as defining what a path is, what it means for a path to be augmenting with respect to a matching, and so on. *)

(* Definition 26.1 - Walk, Path, Cycle
For illustrative purposes, we can represent a walk, path, or cycle as lists of vertices, with adjacency represented by consecutive vertices in the list. A proper Coq definition would also require a way to check adjacency between vertices, and ensure paths don't have repeated vertices, except for cycles where the start and end are the same. *)
Definition Walk := list V1. (* This simple definition serves as a placeholder *)

(* Theorem 26.3 *)
(*
Theorem walk_to_path: forall G: Graph, forall u v: Vertex, 
  exists_walk G u v -> exists_path G u v.
Proof.
Induction and graph traversal techniques would be required here.
*)

(* Definition 26.4 - Connected Graph *)
(* This definition would involve verifying that for any two vertices in the graph, there is a path connecting them. In Coq, this would likely be a predicate over the graph structure. *)

(* Definition 26.5 - Connected Component *)
(* This would similarly involve subsets of the graph that are themselves connected graphs and are maximal with this property. *)

(* Theorem 26.7 and Theorem 26.9, and related remarks, highlight properties about walks and connectedness that could, in theory, be formalized in Coq, but require dealing with specifics of matrix multiplication and graph representation in a way that is abstracted away in this document. *)

(* Definition 26.10 - Augmenting Path for M *)
(* The formal definition would require a representation of matchings and the ability to check the alternating property of edges in the path with respect to the matching. *)

(* Theorem 26.12 - Bipartite graphs and cycles of odd length *)
(*
Theorem bipartite_iff_no_odd_cycle: forall G: Graph,
  is_bipartite G <-> no_odd_length_cycle G.
Proof.
This proof would leverage breadth-first search or a similar approach to color the graph, proving that a graph is bipartite if and only if it does not contain any odd-length cycles.
*)

(* Conclusion:
This document illustrates the process of thinking about discrete mathematics concepts in terms of types and functions in Coq. While the explicit Coq definitions and proofs are outside the scope of this simple translation, the approach demonstrates how mathematical theorems and concepts can be translated into a form amenable to formal verification and proof in systems like Coq. *)
