(* Multiplicative Inverses Modulo m *)

(* Starting by defining what it means for an integer to be prime and to be relatively prime. *)

Definition prime (p : nat) := (p > 1) /\ 
  forall d : nat, (d | p) -> d = 1 \/ d = p.

Definition coprime (a b : nat) : Prop := Nat.gcd a b = 1.

(* Offering an example to illustrate prime and relatively prime numbers. *)

Example example_8_9: coprime 10 21.
Proof.
  unfold coprime. reflexivity.
Qed.

(* Presenting the theorem that if two integers are relatively prime, 
then there exists a multiplicative inverse modulo the other integer. *)

Theorem theorem_8_10: forall m n : nat, m > 0 -> coprime m n -> 
  exists a : nat, (n * a) mod m = 1.
Proof.
  intros.
  apply Bezout_in_nat in H0.
  destruct H0 as [a [b H0]].
  exists a.
  rewrite <- H0.
  rewrite Nat.mod_add with (b := b) (a := (a*n)) (n := m).

(* Illustrating the theorem with the mod 4 scenario. *)

Example example_8_11: (3 * 3) mod 4 = 1 /\ ~(exists a : nat, (2 * a) mod 4 = 1).

  split.
  - reflexivity.
  - intro H. destruct H as [a H].
    remember ((2 * a) mod 4) as x.
    assert (Hx: x = 0 \/ x = 2) by (subst; auto with *).
    contradiction.

(* Discussing a corollary regarding prime numbers and the existence of multiplicative inverses modulo a prime number. *)

Corollary corollary_8_12: forall p a : nat, prime p -> ~(p | a) -> exists a_inv : nat, (a * a_inv) mod p = 1.
Proof.
  intros.
  apply theorem_8_10.
  - destruct H. auto.
  - unfold coprime. apply Nat.gcd_rel_prime; auto.

(* Proof by Induction *)

(* Defining the principle of mathematical induction. *)

Theorem induction_principle (P: nat -> Prop):

  apply induction_principle.
  - split.

    + intro H. assert (He: even k) by (apply even_succ_odd; exact H).
      specialize (Heven He). destruct Heven as [cs _].
      exists cs. contradict H0.

(* The Peano Axioms *)

(* The Peano axioms are foundational to the natural numbers and to induction. *)

Definition zero_is_natural : nat := 0.

Inductive successor (n: nat) : Prop :=
  | is_natural: successor n.

Definition peano_addition (n m: nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => m
  | S p => S (peano_addition p m)
  end.

(* Defining the theorem that addition of zero to any natural number returns the number itself, based on Peano's axioms. *)

Theorem peano_theorem_9_3: forall n, peano_addition n 0 = n.
Proof.
  induction n.
  - reflexivity.
  - simpl. rewrite IHn. reflexivity.
