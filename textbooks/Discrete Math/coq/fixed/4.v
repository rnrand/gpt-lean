(* Predicate Calculus *)

(* The existence of quantifiers provides a compelling justification for an inference system like natural deduction. Whereas previously we could use truth tables to check an arbitrary formula in propositional logic, predicate logic quantifies over potentially infinite sets, rendering this approach impossible.

Instead, we can simply augment our deduction system for propositional logic with rules for ∀ and ∃. Let's start with the universal quantifier: *)

(* Universal Quantification Rules *)

(* ∀-I and ∀-E rules as described *)

(* ∀-I (Introduction)
   If we can prove P(a) under the assumption that a is arbitrary (does not have a specific reference or appears among the non-discharged assumptions), then we can conclude ∀x, P(x). *)

(* ∀-E (Elimination)
   If ∀x, P(x) then P(a) for any element "a". *)

(* We simulate these rules as functions in Coq, taking into account that Coq's type system and its handling of quantifiers already implicitly involve these rules in a sound manner. Thus, actual representation might not directly match the given description, as Coq's logic is constructively typed and already encompasses these principles. *)

(* Here is an example to represent the valid use of ∀-I using Coq. This is not an exact translation but shows how to use universality in Coq.*)

Definition D (a:Type) : Prop := True. (* Assuming "D" as a simple proposition for illustrative purposes. *)

Theorem universal_intro_example : forall x, D x -> D x.
Proof.
  intros.
  assumption.
Qed.

(* Similarly, we don't implement the literal ∀-E example but understand that applying any universal truth in Coq to a specific instance is a direct application of this principle. *)

(* Existential Quantification Rules *)

(* ∃-I (Introduction) and ∃-E (Elimination) rules as described *)

(* ∃-I: If P(e) is true for some element e, then ∃x, P(x). *)

(* ∃-E: If ∃x, P(x) and from P(a) one can prove Q (and Q does not depend on a), then Q can be concluded directly. *)

(* Let's simulate these rules with a simple Coq example. *)

Theorem existential_intro_example : exists x : nat, x > 0.
Proof.
  exists 1. (* Taking "e" as 1 for example. *)
  auto with arith.
Qed.

(* The rules for "exists" and usage in inference systems, including natural deduction, are more nuanced and context-dependent in Coq due to its constructive nature. Many classical results require specific formulations or additional axioms within Coq's logic. *)

(* The proofs provided above and the descriptions of natural deduction encompass the essence of predicate calculus as explored in this lecture. The presentation, rules, and formalisms outlined in the HTML document guide the use and understanding of logical statements and proofs within systems like Coq, even though direct one-to-one representation might not align due to the differences in foundational assumptions and mechanisms between Coq and more general logic notation. *)

(* Gödel's completeness theorem, Hilbert-Ackermann proof system, and related discussions highlight the limitations and capabilities of formal systems, including first-order logic and beyond. Coq operates within these boundaries, providing a powerful toolset for formal verification, guided by the principles and limitations of predicate logic and computational logic. *)
