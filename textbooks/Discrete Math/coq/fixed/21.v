(* Title: CMSC 27100 — Lecture 21 *)

(* Random variables and Bernoulli trials *)

(* In the previous lecture, we defined variables like F_4, S_6 and T_7 
   to refer to the events that the first roll of a die was 4, the second was 
   6 and the total was 7. This is a pretty awkward way of expressing a group
   of similar events. In fact, it should be reminiscent of how, in propositional
   logic, we would need to say "A = Alice has a dog", "B = Bob has a dog" etc. *)

(* Just like predicate logic allows us to make general logical statements like
   "D(x) = x has a dog", the language of random variables allows us to
   make more general statements about events. *)

Definition sample_space := nat * nat.

(* Definition 20.1: A random variable on a sample space Ω is a function X : Ω -> ℝ. *)
Definition random_variable := sample_space -> R.

(* Example 20.2: We can define our "first die", "second die", and "total"
   random variables as D1, D2, and T *)
Definition D1 (omega: sample_space) : R := R_of_nat (fst omega).
Definition D2 (omega: sample_space) : R := R_of_nat (snd omega).
Definition T (omega: sample_space) : R := R_of_nat (fst omega + snd omega).

(* Note: The above implementations assume the sample space elements are natural numbers (as they would be for dice rolls),
   and convert them to real numbers since random variables map to ℝ. *)

(* Definition 20.3: If X is a random variable, we define the notation
   Pr(X = r) = Pr({ω ∈ Ω | X(ω) = r}). *)
(* As Coq does not natively support probabilistic measures in the standard library
   in a way that directly models probability theory, precise representation of Pr will
   be context-dependent and thus not directly defined here. This serves as a conceptual 
   definition. *)

(* Example 20.4: Probability of total being four.
   The probability calculus here will be simplified as it requires defining a probability
   measure over the sample space which is out of the scope of this brief example. *)

(* The Distribution of a Random Variable *)

(* Definition 20.3: The distribution of X is the function p_X : ℝ->ℝ defined by 
   p_X(x) = Pr(X = x). *)
Definition distribution (X: random_variable) (x: R) : R.
Admitted. (* Requires a definition of probability space and measure. *)

(* Example: Distribution for D1 and T *)
Definition p_D1 (x: R) : R :=
  match x with
  | 1 => 1/6
  | 2 => 1/6
  | 3 => 1/6
  | 4 => 1/6
  | 5 => 1/6
  | 6 => 1/6
  | _ => 0
  end.

(* The definition for p_T would be more complex, reflecting the distribution of the 
   sum of two die rolls. Here we omit the full implementation for brevity. *)

(* Bernoulli and Binomial Distributions *)

(* Definition 20.5: A Bernoulli trial is a random variable B whose image is {0,1}. *)
Definition bernoulli_trial := sample_space -> {0, 1}.

(* Theorem 20.7: Binomial distribution formula *)
Definition binomial_distribution (n k: nat) (p: R) : R :=
  (C n k) * (p^k) * ((1-p)^(n-k)).

(* This implementation leverages combinatorics functions from Coq's standard library for binomial coefficients (C)
   and represents the binomial distribution formula accurately. *)

Please note:
1. This code omits direct implementations of probability measures and operations, focusing instead on the structural definitions of concepts like random variables and distributions. In Coq, representing probabilities directly would require a background framework for measure theory that is not part of the standard library.
2. Some simplifications were necessarily made, especially regarding working with real numbers in Coq and defining certain probability-related functions which require more complex measure-theoretic backgrounds.
