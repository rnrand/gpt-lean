(* Theorem 22.9 (Chebyshev's Inequality) *)
(* Let X be a random variable. For all a > 0,
   Pr(|X - E(X)| >= a) <= V(X) / a^2. *)

Theorem Chebyshev_Inequality: forall (X: R -> R) (E V a: R),
  a > 0 ->
  (* Assuming the premises without loss of generality for this example *)
  (* E represents E(X) and V represents V(X) under given conditions *)
  (* This part should ideally be derived from definitions of E and V based on X *)
  let Y := fun x => (X x - E)^2 in
  E Y = V ->
  Pr (fun x => Rabs (X x - E) >= a) <= V / (a ^ 2).
Proof.

  (* The proof would follow from the definition of Pr, E, and V, 
     using the Markov's inequality and the properties of absolute 
     value and squares. As the actual implementation of probability functions 
     like Pr, E, etc., is not defined in this snippet, 
     we assert the conclusion directly assuming the premises. *)

Qed.

(* Example 22.10 shows how Chebyshev's inequality can be applied
   to the number of heads in n tosses of a fair coin.*)

(* Example 22.11 demonstrates the implication of Chebyshev's inequality
   when we set a to εn for some small ε. *)

(* Theorem 22.12 (Chernoff's Inequality) *)
(* Let X be a binomial random variable n trials and probability of success p.
   Then for all a > 0, Pr(|X - E(X)| >= a) <= 2 / exp(2a^2/n). *)

(* Chernoff's Inequality is stated without a proof. The detailed proof
   involves more intricate properties of binomial random variables and
   exponential bounds. *)

(* Example 22.13 explores practical applications of Markov's, Chebyshev's,
   and Chernoff's inequalities in the context of coin tosses. *)

(* Probability Theory in Action *)
(* This section describes an analysis based on a New York Times article 
   regarding the Risk-Return Trade-Off, involving dice rolls and expected 
   returns. It includes calculations of expected values and variances for 
   a particular game, along with implications based on Chebyshev's inequality
   and the Law of Large Numbers. *)

(* Due to the Coq snippet being illustrative rather than fully executable 
   in the context of probability theory without explicitly defined primitives 
   for randomness, expectation, variance, and probability distributions, 
   full implementation details are not provided. The mathematical statements 
   and examples show how one could theoretically express these concepts 
   within a more comprehensive Coq development that includes appropriate 
   definitions of these probabilistic terms. *)

(* The article discussion is intended to highlight the practical implications 
   of understanding probability theory and deviation bounds, illustrating 
   the relevance to financial decision-making and risk assessment. *)

(* Note: To fully implement these examples and theorems in Coq, one would 
   need a comprehensive library that defines probabilistic primitives like 
   random variables, expectation, variance, and probability measures, 
   along with properties of real numbers and functions over them. *)

Admitted. (* Placeholder for the entire development, as detailed implementations are omitted. *)
