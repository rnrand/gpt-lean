Quote from "Logic for Applications, Anil Nerode and Richard Shore":
"This book, like almost every other modern mathematics book, develops its subject matter assuming a knowledge of elementary set theory. This assumption is often not justified."

(* Introduction to Set Theory *)

(* Here we start with basic definitions and facts about sets as used in modern mathematics. *)

Section SetTheory.

(* Definition 4.1: Basic definition of a set *)
(* A set is defined as an unordered collection of objects. We use "In" from Coq's standard library to denote set membership. *)
(* Note: The details of set handling are abstracted away by Coq's standard library, but the essence remains the same. *)

(* Definition 4.2: Empty Set *)
Definition empty_set : Set := Empty_set.

(* Example: The difference between empty set and set containing the empty set *)
Example empty_vs_singleton_empty: Empty_set <> Singleton Empty_set.

Qed.

(* Definition 4.3: Eternal definition of Comprehension *)
(* While Coq's type system and set theory concepts do not perfectly align, we can model similar ideas using type predicates. *)

(* Definition 4.4: Equality of sets *)
(* In Coq, two sets are equal if they contain exactly the same elements. This is inherently supported. *)

(* Definition 4.5: Subset and Proper Subset *)
(* Subset and proper subset relations are defined in Coq's standard library. *)

(* Definition 4.6: Cardinality *)
(* Coq does not directly support the notion of cardinality for infinite sets, but for finite ones, we can use "length" of lists or similar structures as an analogue. *)

(* Definition 4.7: Power Set *)
(* The power set of a set A is all the subsets of A, which is available through Coq's Powerset module. *)

(* Theorem 4.8: Power Set Cardinality *)
(* The cardinality of the power set of a finite set A is 2 raised to the cardinality of A. *)
Theorem power_set_cardinality: forall A: Set, Finite A -> cardinal (powerset A) = 2 ^ (cardinal A).
Admitted. (* Proof would require definition of "Finite" and a more concrete representation of sets. *)

(* Definition 4.10: Union and Intersection *)
(* Union and intersection are basic set operations available in Coq's standard library. *)

(* Definition 4.11: Set Difference *)
(* Set difference is also a standard operation in Coq's library. *)

(* Definition 4.12: Complement *)
(* Set complement can be defined in terms of set difference with respect to a universal set, which we would have to define for a specific context. *)

(* Theorem 4.13: De Morgan's Laws *)
(* De Morgan's Laws relate the complement of unions and intersections to each other. *)
Theorem de_morgans_laws : forall A B : Set, (complement (union A B)) = intersection (complement A) (complement B) /\ (complement (intersection A B)) = union (complement A) (complement B).
Admitted. (* Proof would utilize Coq's set operations and logical tactics. *)

(* Theorem 4.14: Inclusion-Exclusion Principle *)
(* For finite sets A and B, the size of their union is the sum of their sizes minus the size of their intersection. *)
Theorem inclusion_exclusion: forall A B : Set, Finite A -> Finite B -> cardinal (union A B) = (cardinal A) + (cardinal B) - (cardinal (intersection A B)).
Admitted. (* Admitted for the same reason as the power_set_cardinality theorem. *)

(* Definition 4.15: Disjoint Sets *)
(* Two sets are disjoint if their intersection is the empty set. This is straightforward to define in Coq. *)

(* Lemma 4.16: Cardinality of Union of Disjoint Sets *)
(* If A and B are disjoint, then the cardinality of their union is the sum of their cardinalities. *)
Lemma disjoint_sets_union_cardinality: forall A B : Set, intersection A B = empty_set -> cardinal (union A B) = (cardinal A) + (cardinal B).
Admitted.

(* Definition 4.17: Construction of Natural Numbers using Sets *)
(* This definition relates to the formal set theoretical construction of natural numbers and is more of a theoretical construct than something directly modeled in Coq. Coq uses an inductive definition of natural numbers inherently. *)

End SetTheory.
