(* Strong Induction *)

(* The lecture discusses the concept of strong induction, particularly in relation to proving the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. *)

(* Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: Every natural number n > 1 can be written uniquely as a product of primes. Although we will not formalize "uniquely" for now, we consider the existence part. *)

(* Definition of Strong Induction *)

(*
  Definition 11.2: Strong Induction Principle
  Let P(n) be a statement that depends on n ∈ ℕ. If
  1. P(0), and
  2. for all n ∈ ℕ, if P(k) for all k < n, then P(n)
  are both true, then the following is true:
  3. for all n ∈ ℕ, P(n) holds.
*)

(* The main difference between ordinary induction and strong induction lies in the hypothesis. In strong induction, the hypothesis is stronger, incorporating all previous instances up to k to assert P(k+1). *)

(* Strong Induction is an alternate form of mathematical induction and not fundamentally stronger in terms of proving capabilities. It simply provides a more convenient way to structure some proofs. *)

(* Proof Structure for Strong Induction:
   1. State the statement P you want to prove.
   2. Base case: Prove P(0).
   3. Inductive case: Assume P(k) for all k < n, and then prove P(n).
*)

(* Theorem 11.1a: Existence part of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic *)

Theorem fundamental_theorem_arithmetic_existence: forall n, n > 1 -> exists primes : list nat, 
  (forall p, In p primes -> prime p) /\ (fold_right Nat.mul 1 primes = n).

(* Fibonacci Numbers *)

(* Fibonacci numbers are defined by a simple recurrence relation: f_0 = 0, f_1 = 1, and f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2} for n ≥ 2. This setup is amenable to proofs by induction. *)

(* Definition of Fibonacci Numbers *)

Fixpoint fib (n : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => 0
  | S 0 => 1
  | S (S n') as n => fib n' + fib (S n')
  end.

(* Binet's Formula: Provides an exact representation of the nth Fibonacci number in terms of the golden ratio and its conjugate. *)

(* Theorem 11.4: Binet's formula for Fibonacci numbers *)

(* Due to Coq's limitations with real numbers and their operations, a formal proof of Binet's formula within Coq would require a substantial amount of machinery related to real numbers, which we currently do not set up for simplicity. *)

(* Algorithmic Implications *)

(* The lecture ends with a discussion of the Euclidean algorithm and its efficiency. Theorem 11.5 (Lamé's Theorem) relates the sequence of numbers obtained from Euclid's algorithm with the Fibonacci sequence to give an upper bound on the number of steps in the algorithm. *)

(* Lamé's Theorem: If a sequence of numbers a_n > a_{n-1} > ... > a_1 > a_0 = 0 is obtained from Euclid's algorithm, then a_i ≥ f_i for all i ≤ n. *)

(* We cannot directly formalize Lamé's Theorem or its corollary about the bound on the number of division steps required in Euclid's algorithm without setting up the specifics of the algorithm and dealing with additional background on sequences. These are complex enough that a proper encoding would exceed this comment-based illustration. *)

This Coq script represents a structured approach to encapsulating the main mathematical and algorithmic themes discussed in Lecture 12, focusing on Strong Induction, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, Fibonacci numbers, and touches upon algorithmic implications, including a mention of Euclid's algorithm and Lamé's theorem. The actual representations and proofs, when feasible, adhere to the constraints and limitations of Coq, especially in regards to handling real numbers and algorithmic analysis.
