(* Natural Deduction *)

(* 
  Consider the following proposition: 
  ¬(A ∨ B) ∧ A → C ∧ D ∧ F ∧ G ∧ H ∧ I ∧ J 
  It isn't too hard to see why this is (vacuously) true: A contradicts ¬(A ∨ B).
  On the other hand, we don't want to construct a truth table for this. 
*)

(* 
  In general, if you have n different propositional variables, you're looking at 
  a truth table of size 2^n. To avoid this, we use inference rules to allow us to 
  deduce propositions from other propositions. In this class, we will use a system 
  called natural deduction, though several equivalent systems exist. In natural deduction, 
  we write P → Q to say that we can use P (which appears on the top as an assumption) 
  to prove Q (our conclusion).
*)

(* And and Or Rules *)

(* 
  For every connective, we have some number of introduction and elimination rules, 
  which respectively allow us to derive a compound proposition and to use one. 
*)

(* Here is how we would represent the example given in the lecture in Coq: *)
Lemma example : ~(A \/ B) /\ A -> C /\ D /\ F /\ G /\ H /\ I /\ J.
Proof.
  intros.
  destruct H as [H1 H2].
  exfalso. apply H1. left. apply H2.
Qed.

(* Distilling the essence of the natural deduction example with And and Or rules. *)
Lemma and_or_rules : (A /\ B) -> (B \/ A).
Proof.
  intro H.
  destruct H as [HA HB].
  right. apply HA.
Qed.

(* Constructing an Implication *)

(* Modus Ponens Example *)
Lemma modus_ponens : (A -> B) -> A -> B.
Proof.
  intros H1 H2.
  apply H1.
  assumption.
Qed.

(* Example of using implication and OR rules together. *)
Lemma imp_or_rules : (A \/ B) -> (B \/ A).
Proof.
  intros H.
  destruct H as [HA | HB].
  - (* Case A *)
    right.
    assumption.
  - (* Case B *)
    left.
    assumption.
Qed.

(* Negation and Falsehood *)

(* 
  Most deductive systems treat ¬P as simple shorthand for P -> ⊥, 
  which we read as "P implies false". Here's how we might capture that using Coq:
*)

Lemma explosion : False -> A.
Proof.
  intros H.
  destruct H.
Qed.

(* Representation of the principle of explosion in Coq. *)
Lemma principle_explosion : (A \/ B) /\ ~(A \/ B) -> C.
Proof.
  intros H.
  destruct H as [H1 H2].
  contradiction.
Qed.

(* Our system is not yet complete. In the next class, we'll discuss the Law of the Excluded Middle (P ∨ ¬P) before generalizing our system to Predicate Calculus. *)

The code above represents a Coq interpretation of the HTML document, incorporating the presented natural deduction principles, examples, and theorems into corresponding Coq proofs and definitions. Not all elements of natural deduction proofs (such as the detailed steps shown in the prooftree diagrams) directly translate to Coq's syntax, but I have demonstrated the essential logic and proofs as closely as possible within Coq’s capabilities and idioms.
