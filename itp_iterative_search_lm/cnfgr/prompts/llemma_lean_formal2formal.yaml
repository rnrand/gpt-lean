  Given the Lean 4 tactic state, suggest a next tactic.
  Here are some examples:

  Tactic state:
  ---
  α : Type u_1
  r : α → α → Prop
  inst✝¹ : DecidableEq α
  inst✝ : IsIrrefl α r
  ⊢ CutExpand r ≤ InvImage (Finsupp.Lex (rᶜ ⊓ fun x x_1 => x ≠ x_1) fun x x_1 => x < x_1) ↑toFinsupp
  ---
  Next tactic:
  ---
  rintro s t ⟨u, a, hr, he⟩
  ---

  Tactic state:
  ---
  ι : Type u_1
  I✝ J✝ : Box ι
  x y : ι → ℝ
  I J : WithBot (Box ι)
  ⊢ ↑I = ↑J ↔ I = J
  ---
  Next tactic:
  ---
  simp only [Subset.antisymm_iff, ← le_antisymm_iff, withBotCoe_subset_iff]
  ---

  Tactic state:
  ---
  m n : ℕ
  h : Nat.coprime m n
  ⊢ Nat.gcd m n = 1
  ---
  Next tactic:
  ---
  rw [← h.gcd_eq_one]
  ---

  Tactic state:
  ---
  {}

  Next tactic:
